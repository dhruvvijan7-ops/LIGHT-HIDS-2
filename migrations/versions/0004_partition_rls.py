"""Partition-level row-level security (M0-A1).

Declarative partition children do NOT inherit ``ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY``
from their parent, and ``CREATE POLICY ... ON parent`` does not apply to
children either.  schema.sql (post-M0) therefore enables and polices all 11
partition children explicitly; this migration brings databases that were
created before that contract change — e.g. the live dev database, which is
already at 0003 — up to the same shape.

Idempotent by construction: ``ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`` is a no-op when
already enabled, and every ``CREATE POLICY`` is guarded by an
``IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_policies)`` check so re-running is safe.

Children and the USING expression they inherit from their parent:

  events         → events_2026_10 / _11 / _12
  findings       → findings_2026_10 / _11 / _12
  audit_log      → audit_log_2026_10 / _11 / _12
  rule_baseline  → rule_baseline_2026 / _2027

See research/DEVIATION_REGISTER.md (M0-A1) for the amendment record.
